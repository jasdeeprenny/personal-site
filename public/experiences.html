                    <h3>Westpac Asian Exchange Scholar</h3>
                    <p>I was 1 of 37 in Australia to be awarded the Westpac Asian Scholarship, which funds students to participate in exchange programs in Asia. I am currently studying at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, in the school of Electrical and Electronics Engineering.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to bias the opportunity of being young, funded, and in Asia to travel as much as I possibly could. During my 7 months abroad, I went on 13 trips and visited 11 different countries! Not bad :)</p>

                    <h3>Engineering Intern @ Hand Plus Robotics</h3>
                    <p>Before starting my exchange at NTU, I wanted to explore the experience of working at a startup in South-East Asia. By reaching out to a friend of mine who connected me to a founder, I found myself interning at Hand Plus Robotics in Puchong, Malaysia (about 1.5 hrs SW of Kuala Lampur).</p>
                    <p>I was assigned a project where I had to develop the vision system of an autonomous welding robot from the ground up.</p>
